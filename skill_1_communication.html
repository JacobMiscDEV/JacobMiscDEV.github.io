					<h2 class="section-head"><span id="Communication-jump" class="jump-top"><span class="jump-bottom">Communication Skills</span></span></h2>
					<p>
						The three primary traits of effective communication skills I possess are: leadership, teamwork and general communication.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section-subhead">Leadership</h3>
					<p>
						Over the course of my educational and professional career I have had several opportunities to develop leadership skills. The main cases where I have had such experience is during my school career where I have had to work on group projects and taken up the role of leader and organiser for the group when I was the most experienced with the subject matter. This primarily was during software development projects where I had to help lead and organise my group while also assisting them with learning new techniques for software development as they were less experienced than me. These tasks gave me valuable experience in learning how to lead a small team to work on a project.
						<br>
						A second example of leadership is the cases where I have had to teach new staff how to perform certain jobs at my workplace. At my current place of employement I have had training in the majority of the work that gets completed across every department in the business. As such, I have often been responsible for teaching new staff members how certain processes work and what work we do. These experiences have also helped to improve my leadership skills in a professional situation.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section-subhead">Teamwork</h3>
					<p>
						Teamwork has been an extremely important part of my life both personally and professional. Throughout every job that I have done so far teamwork has been extremely important for ensuring all work was completed in a timely manner and to a high standard. This has involved working with other crew members working in the same department as me but also collaborating with crew members from other departments at the same time while I have to had coordinate between the two. Futhermore, very similarly to above, completing group projects for school helped to initially teach me what working as a team meant and showed me how to effectively communicate with my time members to ensure everybody can comfortably work together. When combined, all these experiences have helped improve my teamwork abilities.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section-subhead">General Communication</h3>
					<p>
						Life in general is all about communication between yourself and others.
						<br>
						As a result, throughout my entire life I have been learning how to communicate with others both in the moment and in the future, in non-verbal formats such as writing. Spending 2 years working in customer service helped me develop the necessary skills to effectively communicate with people I have met for the first time. Additionally, this experience helped teach me how to navigate troublesome communication with customers.
						<br>
						Additionally, once again my school life has had a major impact on my general communication. Presenting various projects to my class and consulting with teachers helped to build my group communication and one-on-one communication skills. Futhermore, being on both sides of a meeting, as both the primary speaker and an enquiring audience member, I have learned a lot about how communication between two people is supposed to work in a respectful and polite way. All of these experiences have provided me with the skills and abilities for effective general communication.
