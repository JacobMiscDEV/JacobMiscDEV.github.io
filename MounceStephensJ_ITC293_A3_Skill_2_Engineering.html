					<p>
						I have a lot of the necessary backing to become a successful engineer. My primary fields of study throughout my life have been in mathematics and science which together provide a very strong foundation for the field of engineering. Additionally, I hold myself to a very high standard ensuring that I am putting my best work forward, an essential skill for engineering where the reliability and safety of the end product is crucial for success.<br><br>
						During my educational career I have also spent some time studying architecture and basic, small scale engineering. These two experiences are extremely important to me. While studying architecture I learned about much of the process which comes with the foundational design process of any design. This includes learning about investigating the need for a new design as well as waht components and features a successful design might include. Futhermore, trhis study explored the process of designing and forming a blueprint and plan before prototyping and implementing those plans. This experience providing me with many of the skills and knowledge required to navigate the planning and research components of any planning process, an essential skill for any engineering endevour.<br>
						Futhermore, I studied engineering which in combination with my further study into physics has provided me with much of the foundational knowledge required to know what to look for during an engineering process. For example, when it comes to electrical vehicles there is much to consider. There are of course obvious things to consider such as enginer construction and positioning but then also the less obvious things like drag reduction via the shape of the vehicle and weight distribution.
