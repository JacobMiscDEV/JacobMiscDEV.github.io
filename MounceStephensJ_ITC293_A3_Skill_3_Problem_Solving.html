					<p>
						As described on my 'about' page, I studied extension 1 & 2 mathematics at highschool. As well as discrete and computer driven mathematics at university.<br>
						As a result of these expriences, I am knowledgeable of a wide range of mathematical topics such as, but not limited to:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Statistics</li>
						<li>Probabilities</li>
						<li>Algebra</li>
						<li>Calculus - Basic & advanced, derivatives & integration</li>
						<li>Trigonometry</li>
						<li>Induction</li>
						<li>Optimisation</li>
						<li>Transcendental arithmetic</li>
						<li>Function analysis</li>
						<li>Complex arithmetic</li>
						<li>Analytical continuation</li>
						<li>Vector & Matrix operations</li>
						<li>Mechanics</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Utilisation of these skills allowed me to achieve top marks in each math subject I studied in highschool and has given me the skills necessary to have the confidence to apporach almost all common mathematical problems, and the drive to learn how to solve problems I do not know how to approach.<br>
						So far, the main portions of math I have utilised are related to vectors and matrices due to their very wide application to computer graphics and computer programming in general.

					<p>
						As a large fan of mathematics, I naturally also have a strong passion and interest into various forms of science but my primary interests lie in physics, chemistry and astronomy.<br>
					</p>
					<h3 class="section-subhead">Physics</h3>
					<p>
						Physics has always been my primary interest in the vast world of scientific research and information. I have had opporunties to explore various sub-fields such as mechanics, astrophysics, electromagnetic radiation and all sides of electricity. Most notably, I have spent a lot of time studying the mechanics of what allows things to move and the forces required in such situations providing me with insight into the mechanics of vehicles and optimising the power they require. Futhermore, research into electrical circuits, systems and particularly engines and motors as well as the properties of electricity and electrical circuits has given me insight into how such systems are constructed and operated.<br>
						As a result, I have a lot of background knowledge into the principles and mechanisms that are involved in much of what makes electric vehicles possible and am always ready to learn more to expand my knowledge.
					</p>
					<h3 class="section-subhead">Chemistry</h3>
					<p>
							Chemistry was my other main science subject that I studied. It provided me with a lot of knowledge about atoms, molecules and the interactions between them. While largely not necessarily related to electric vehicles, at least not as much as physics, it has provided some useful insight and knowledge I otherwise would have lacked. For example, studying chemistry provided some insight into the not-so-obvious reactions that could occur within a vechicles motor due to the electricity running through various materials possible enabling reactions between wires, circuitry and the air presnet around and within components.

					<p>
						So far, I have largely been a self-taught software developer. I consider myself to be reasonbly proficient with Python and C++ primarily however I have enough backgorund knowledge to be able to adapt to most languages I might need. My primary interest lies in computer graphics and thus is where I have spent most of my time researching and learning about. Additionally, however, I have spent time learning basic principles of program design and architecture to solve problems with better solutions. My experience with programming is very useful for enhancing my problem solving abilities as well as my ability to analyse a system as a whole, such as what the side effects an addition to a system could be.
